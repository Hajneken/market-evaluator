# About 

This directory contains the documentation including architecture diagrams. 
Currently front-end is implemented, back-end is not and has only a prospective architecture.

## Architecture

The prospective architecture is straightforward. The front-end is a Vue.js application that uses Vuetify for the UI. The back-end is planned to be a Node.js application that uses Express.js for the API.
